Download and install the lastest version of [Git.](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

<img class=center src="./images/GitDownload.png" height='480'/>

## Mac Users
Install the downloaded file by clicking on the downloaded `*.dmg` file then clicking on the `*.pkg` file. 

<img class=center src="./images/MacGitDownload.png" height='200'/>

If you get a message indicating the file is from an untrusted source, ignore the warning and click on the **Open** button.  If there is no option to **Open**, hold down the CTRL key, select `*.pkg` file, then choose *Open With -> Installer (default)*.

## Windows users

Once the download is complete, right click on the downloaded file to install it as an 
administrator.  Use the default options at each step of the installation if you are unsure 
what you are doing.  When the installation arrives at the screen adjusting your PATH 
environment, click in the circle to the left of **Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt**.
You may need to manually add the path to where the `bash.exe` resides.  Run the 
following at the `R` prompt to make sure `R` knows where to find `bash`.


```r
Sys.which("bash")
```

```
                              bash 
"C:\\PROGRA~2\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe" 
```

If the output does not specify the path to `bash`, the path to `bash` is not properly configured.


## Initial Setup

If you have never used git before, you need to do some setup first.  Run the following
commands so that git knows your name and email.  The commands are all issued in the
Terminal (Mac) or at the command prompt of Git Bash (Windows).  The Terminal 
application is usually found in `/applications/Utilities`. A quick way to open a 
**terminal** window is by clicking on the magnifying glass icon and typing *terminal* in spotlight.

By clicking on the Terminal application, a Terminal window will open.

<img class=center src="./images/TerminalWindow.png" height='150'/>

To open Git Bash, click on the *Windows icon -> Git -> Git Bash*.  The program is most likely located in the Git directory within your Start Menu (or the directory into which Git was installed).

By clicking on the Git Bash icon, a window similar to the one below will open.

<img class=center src="./images/GitBashWindow.png" height='150'/>

## Run these commands


```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@whatever.com"
git config --global color.ui true
```


If you do not want to type your username and password every time you work with a remote server, you will to install the credential helper.  See the article [Set Up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git#platform-all) for additional details on setting up the credential helper.

To confirm your username and email, type `git config --list` at the $ prompt.


```bash
git config --list
```

```
user.name=Alan Arnholt
user.email=arnholtat@appstate.edu
credential.helper=osxkeychain
color.ui=true
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
core.ignorecase=true
core.precomposeunicode=false
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT4870.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.master.remote=origin
branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
```


From the third line of the previous output, one can see the 
`credential.helper` is being used.

### Creating a GitHub Account

Point your browser to [https://github.com](https://github.com),
type a username in the `Pick a username` box (please use `firstlast`, for example my username is `alanarnholt`), enter your email (use your school email) in the `Your email` box, type in your password in the `Create a password` box. Then, click the `Sign up for GitHub` box and you will have a GitHub account.


### Creating a GitHub Repository

In order to push your local work to a remote repository, you will first need to create
the remote repository. Log in to your GitHub account, click the `New repository` button,
then give your repository a name and optionally a description.  When you finish, click 
the `Create repository` button, and your GitHub repository will be created.  
![AlansGitRepo](./images/CreateGitRepo.png)


This document is stored in the repository [https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT4870](https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT4870) in the folder [https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT4870/Git](https://github.com/alanarnholt/STT4870/Git). 

## Local Repositories

It is possible to set up a local repository using GUI (drop, drag, etc.) commands or to
use the command line.  I keep my repositories in a folder called *git_repositories* that
is a subfolder of my *USERNAME* directory.  Once you have a local folder with files you
would like to place under version control, use the `git init` command from your working
directory to track your files.  If you clone a remote repository to your machine, you 
will not need to initialize your directory.  One way to clone this repo using `RStudio` is 
to click on File -> New Project 

![NewProject](./images/NewProject.png)

Click Version Control and a new window such as the one below will appear where you will select Git.

![VersionControl](./images/VersionControl.png)

In the next window that appears, which is shown below, enter the URL for the repository you are cloning.  Enter a project name and specify where you want the project to reside on your computer.  When you are finished, click the `Create Project` button and you will have cloned a remote repository.

To check the current status of your repository type:

```bash
git status
```

```
# On branch master
# Changes not staged for commit:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#   (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
#
#	modified:   GitOne.html
#	modified:   GitOne.md
#
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#	custom.css
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

The `git status` shows us what files are not staged for a commit.  Before files can be
committed, they must be added to the staging area.  Files are added to the stating area
with the command `git add file_name`.  To add all files in the working directory, one
can use `git add .`  Next, all files are added to the staging area, and a snapshot is 
taken of the commit with the message "staging all files."

```bash
git add .
git commit  -m "staging all files"
```

```
[master eb87352] staging all files
 3 files changed, 60 insertions(+), 45 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 Git/custom.css
```


Check the status after the last commit.

```bash
git status
```

```
# On branch master
# Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
#
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

Push changes to the remote repository. 

```bash
git push
```

See if there is anything left to do.

```bash
git status
```

```
# On branch master
nothing to commit (working directory clean)
```

Show the last three commits with

```bash
git log  -3
```

```

That was ugly. Let us try some formatting.


```bash
git log --pretty=oneline -3
```

```
eb873523a17b492a309a52fe0dd765f493b54908 staging all files

```


The previous output was to brief to suit me.  Let us try some further formatting.


```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad- %s [%an]" -3
```

```

```


Maybe even some statistics?


```bash
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad- %s [%an]" -3 --stat
```

Now, just to show how cool this is, we will mix in a little `R`.


```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = CO2, aes(x = Type, y = uptake, fill = Type)) + geom_boxplot() + 
    facet_grid(Treatment ~ .) + theme_bw()
```

<img src="figure/Rgraph.png" title="plot of chunk Rgraph" alt="plot of chunk Rgraph" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />


I love graphs!  The following graph created with `ggplot2` uses Greek letters in
the facet panels.
